# Word-to-PDF-Converter
A Word to PDF converter is a tool that allows you to convert a Word document (typically in the .doc or .docx format) into a PDF (Portable Document Format) file.

Converting a Word document to PDF format is beneficial when you want to ensure that the document's content, formatting, and layout remain consistent regardless of the device or software used to view it.
